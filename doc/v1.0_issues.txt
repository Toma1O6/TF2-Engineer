--- CAN'T FIX

--- DONE

- Teleporter: Print message to console on sucessful teleporter linking.
- Dispenser: change radius to 3 blocks.
- Dispenser: prevent placing of blocks on second block of dispenser height.
- Sentry: Doesn't heal when whacked with the wrench. Should be 1 heart per 100 mb of metal.

- Sentry: Bullet spread should be tighter, make it 100% accurate.
- Sentry: Change bullet origin to barrel muzzle.
- Sentry: Rename "entity.tf2engineer.sentry" to "Sentry Gun" if possible.
